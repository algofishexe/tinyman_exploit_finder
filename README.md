# tinyman_exploit_finder

There was a big tinyman exploit. You can read about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HEADLINECrypto/comments/rufvse/tinyman_attack_report_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

This script works to find exploiters for a given pool. It currently only works for ASSET/ALGO pairs but can be trivially updated for ASSET/ASSET pairs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install Python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the tinyman SDK: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/tinymanorg/tinyman-py-sdk.git`.
4. Set up a developer account on https://purestake.com.
5. Put your API key in `headers.json` where there is currently a placeholder.
6. Replace your asset ID for swapping in `parse_for_exploiters.py` as `ID_A`.

## Running

The script is currently set up for the goBTC/ALGO pair, and the examples below are from this pair.

Run `python3 parse_for_exploiters.py`. If all went well, you should start to see something like this:

When exploits are found, their group ID will be printed like so:

You can search these group IDs on algoexplorer to confirm them:
